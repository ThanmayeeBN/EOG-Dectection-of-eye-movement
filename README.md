# EOG-Dectection-of-eye-movement
The prototype uses the human brain EOG (electro-ocular-graph) signal picked up by electrodes placed on the sides of a person's head to carry out the eye movement detection and control tasks.
In addition, practical control system design and implementation using micro controllers are studied and implemented to carry out the natural eye movement detection and artificial robotic eye control tasks.
